This project is an intent to build a first very simple DApp minting NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain using Solidity, combined with a VueJS frontend.

It is mostly inspired from a tutorial from Dapp University (https://github.com/dappuniversity/nft) adapting it to the latest versions of Solidity, Truffle, Ganache and changing the React Frontend with VueJS.

FRONTEND

To run this project you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

First, install dependencies with `npm install`.

You can then run the project locally using `npm run start`.

BLOCKCHAIN PART

Setup a Ganache test blockchain (https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) and Metamask wallet (https://metamask.io/).

Use truffle (https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview) to experiment and test the smart contracts.
